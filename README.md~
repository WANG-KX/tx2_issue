This code performs badly on TX2 for reason we do not know.
to run the code, just:

git clone 
cd tx2_issue
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./sgm

the performance will print out and the result will show on the screen.

Below is the performance for reference, all the CmakeLists are the same except the arch code in line 15, in which we set TITAN XP:61 TX2: 62, TX1: 53.
In TX2, before we run the code, we already set:
nvpmodel -m 0
./jetson_clocks.sh

TITAN XP
